      <b> Software Engineer (September 2017-)</b>
      <br><i> Dialog Semiconductor </i>
      <ul>
      <li> On a given day I am brainstorming about modern tech that my team and I could use to complement legacy systems with the goal of extending and improving system functionality and user experience </li>
      <li> Lead the design and implementation of a Continuous Integration and Deployment strategy with Jenkins. The goal of this is to define a standard pipeline that will be used to automate the build, test and deployment of application staging and production environments. </li>
      <li> Designed a distributed system to automate processing of special configuration files. Flask was my framework of choice, Celery worker to asynchronously process files, Redis was used as the message broker and Flower to monitor celery tasks. Thanks to this blog (<a href = "http://allynh.com/blog/flask-asynchronous-background-tasks-with-celery-and-redis/">Flask asynchronous background tasks with Celery and Redis</a>) for getting me started! </li>
      <li> Develop a Spring Boot microservice responsible for triggering database functions and performing manipulation of data asynchronously. To leverage this service, I developed a SPA built with Angular 1.7 where users can submit requests to the backend and view real time status of their requests. Users receive a notification email when the request is complete with a detailed summary of their request. </li>
      <li> Develop a Spring Boot microservice hosting a REST API responsible for retrieving large amounts of data. To leverage this service, I developed a React SPA responsible for accessing batches of data. The goal was to be able to load millions of rows of data and be able to quickly filter records with no lagging.  </li>
      <li> Deploy Spring Boot's Config Server with the purpose of centralizing configuration files for all  applications across staging and production environments </li>
      <li> Develop full stack applications using ZK framework primarily for data management purposes </li>
      <li> Experiment with Docker as a means for spinning up development environments </li>
      <li> Experiment with ELK (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash) stack as a centralized logging solution with the goal of providing timely log analysis </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
