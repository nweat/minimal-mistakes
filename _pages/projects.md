<h1><a href = "https://github.com/wisebits">Wisebits URL Shortner</a></h1>
<br>Developed a secured service that allows authorized users to generate and share shortened URLs. Registered users can create a shortened URL that is secure and shareable among users with appropriate permissions. The service was built in Ruby (Sinatra) using Slim and Bootstrap for the client application. We used heroku and postgres to host our services and databases. We made use of Rbnacl cryptographic libraries for implementing security features: <a href = "https://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl">https://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl</a>
<br><b><i>Gained experience in developing a secured distributed architecture which included:</i></b>
<br>- Securing databases through SQL injection, mass assignment restrictions, ORM based encryption
<br>- User Authentication
<br>- Password hashing (Salt + Hash + Key stretching)
<br>- Token based Authentication (secured session and cookies, safe user registration and authorization)
<br>- Token based Authorization (Signed client apps (JWK), secure API requests)
<br>- OAuth Authorization Protocol
<br>- Preventing XSS/CSRF attacks, protecting HTTP headers
<br>- API and interface testing
<br>- Defining access control
<br>- Enforce SSL/TLS

<h1><a href = "https://github.com/ZhongMeiZhou">TraViz</a></h1>
<br>Developed TraViz Web Application and Data API service. TraViz allows users to generate visualizations of lonely planet tour listings based on specified countries, categories and price range. The service was built in Ruby (Sinatra) using Slim and Bootstrap for the client application.
<br><b><i>Gained experience in developing a service following a modern service oriented architecture design:</i></b>
<br>- Followed Agile development model
<br>- Ruby gem created for lonely planet web scraping (OGA)
<br>- Continuos integration (Travis CI)
<br>- Continuos deployment (Heroku, Codeship)
<br>- Distributed Postgres database
<br>- Heavy emphasis on testing (Minitest, Stubs)
<br>- Interface design and testing (mobile first interface)
<br>- Data visualization (HighCharts, Chartkick)
<br>- Reactive user experience using background jobs, queues, web sockets, web caching
<br>- Refactored MVC with OOP (service, value, form objects)

<h1>Coral Bleaching Information System</h1>
<br>This application was designed to allow for easy management of data (CRUD), perform data analysis and provide insightful visualizations to environmental researchers. The application was built using PHP CodeIgniter framework and JavaScript/JQuery
<br><b><i>Major Features/Tasks:</i></b>
<br>- File upload functionality to allow upload of data entry records from custom excel templates
<br>- HighCharts library was used for generating graphs
<br>- Spatial visualization of analysis results was developed using Google Maps, PHP, MySQL, AJAX, XML
<br>- AJAX and JQuery was used for enhanced user experience (DataTables, jQuery datepicker)
<br>- Developed complex SQL queries for generation of analysis reports
<br>- Implemented SQL injection techniques
<br>- User authentication and user access levels were implemented
<br>- Used FPDF PDF generator library to allow users to save reports as PDF files
