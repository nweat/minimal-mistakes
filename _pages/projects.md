### Major Features:

- Uploading data from custom excel templates provided to users
- Displaying dynamic graphs of analysis results using HighCharts interactive graphing tool
- Displaying dynamic summary analysis results (Google Maps, PHP, XML, MySQL, AJAX)
- AJAX and JQuery for enhanced user experience
- Use of licensed software PHP Report Maker to generate reports
- Generating SQL queries for analysis, manipulation and accessing data
- Implementing SQL injection techniques
- Defining user access levels
- Developing a user guide and organizing training sessions

This application was an existing PHP application built using the Codeigniter framework. I had to understand and modify existing code to enhance this application which involved:

- Designing an improved user friendly data entry interface where users upload data from custom excel templates. The previous data entry interface was very slow and required download of a `jar` file everytime there were updates.
- Generating reports as PDF files
- Development of an interactive map displaying coral bleaching summary results (Google Maps, PHP, XML, MySQL, AJAX)
- Developing a user guide and organizing training sessions

      <span class="underline"><b>Service Security (2016)</b> </span>
      <br><b><a href = "https://github.com/wisebits">Wisebits URL Shortner</a></b> 
      <br>Developed a secured service that allows authorized users to generate and share shortened URLs. Registered users can create a shortened URL that is secure and shareable among users with appropriate permissions. The service was built in Ruby (Sinatra) using Slim and Bootstrap for the client application. We used heroku and postgres to host our services. We made use of Rbnacl cryptographic libraries for implementing security features <a href = "https://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl">https://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl</a>
      <br><br><b><i>Gained experience in developing a secured distributed architecture which included:</i></b>

      <br>Securing databases through SQL injection, mass assignment restrictions, ORM based encryption
      <br>User Authentication
      <br>Password hashing (Salt + Hash + Key stretching)
      <br>Token based Authentication (secured session and cookies, safe user registration and authorization)
      <br>Token based Authorization (Signed client apps (JWK), secure API requests)
      <br>OAuth Authorization Protocol
      <br>Preventing XSS/CSRF attacks, protecting HTTP headers
      <br>API and interface testing
      <br>Defining access control
      <br>Enforce SSL/TLS
